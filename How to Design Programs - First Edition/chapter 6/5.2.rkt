;; A time is:
;;   (make-time HOURS MINUTES SECONDS)
;; where SECONDS is a number,
;;       MINUTES is a number, and
;;       HOURS is a number.
(define-struct time (hours minutes seconds))

;; time->seconds : time -> number
;; computes the number of seconds since midnight for this time

;; EXAMPLES
;; midnight is 0 seconds after midnight
;; 12:00:01 is 1 second after midnight
;; 12:01:00 is 60 seconds after midnight
;;  1:00:00 is 3600 seconds after midnight
;;  2:03:01 is 3782 seconds after midnight
